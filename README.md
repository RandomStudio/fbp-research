# Comparison of FBP environments

## Node-RED
Pros
- supported by IBM
- default installed on Raspbian OS
- excellent UI for editor
- easy to run locally, in Docker, etc. etc. (not tied to a service)
- made for IoT
- plenty of user-contributed components

Cons
- not many media-specific components (yet) but definitely web, streaming, etc.

## NoFlo
Pros
- already has good support for HTML5 stuff like WebAudio, webcams, canvas drawing, etc.

Cons
- UI has some odd quirks
- documentation about built-in components is very incomplete
